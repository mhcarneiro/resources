## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem
Lack of ventilators. Every extra ventilator can save lives.
Find ventilators to repair, people to repair them. Bring them together.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis
There may be a great deal of discarded ventilators because they are broken and perceived as beyond repair. However, I've seen a great deal of people in our slack community with the necessary skills to repair a ventilator and the ability to model and print a missing part.

### 🤔 Assumptions
- We could get institutional reach for clinics, hospitals.
- Hospitals / Clinics would be willing to provide their broken ventilators with or without expectation of return, either ot be repaired of for parts to fix another ventilator.
- We are able to get Service Manuals for broken ventilators
- 

## 💻Implementation Suggestion

### V1
Build a website (i.e. http://repairventilators.com/ ) with a simple premisse:
- Find people with a ventilator that needs repair, allow them to send pics, post their location.
- Find people able to repair a ventilator
- Find people willing to transport the ventilator to the workshop of someone able to repair it, or from the workshop to a hospital.
- Find hospitals that would be willing to receive the repaired ventilator.

### What it is
- A way for hospitals/clinics to let the world known they have a ventilator out of comission (for repair) 
- A way to find the right people to diagnose and repair a ventilator that is out of comission
- A way to find people with vans/trucks, willing to transport fixed/broken ventilators.
- (Maybe) An aggregator for service manuals that may assist in repairing.

### What it is not
- An acquisition platform for ventilators
- 

### Design

### Data/Experiments


V2 (..repeat the process)

## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution
- Every new ventilator will potentially save lives.

## 🙌 Criteria for Success
- Reach of communication (to be feasible, logistics need to be local, within the same city)

## 😅 Known Issues
- Deciding where a repaired ventilator goes to.
